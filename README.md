I have more ideas than time. I am one of the lucky few who's job is also their passion, so I program in my free time a good bit. 

You can find my main home page here, though I don't keep up with it like I should: [mawburn.com](https://mawburn.com)

## Projects worth noting

![Portaler Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mawburn/mawburn/main/portaler.webp)   
I created and run a project called [Portaler](https://portaler.zone). It's a collaborative mapping application for an MMORPG called Albion Online. As of this writing, I get roughly 20,000 unique vistors a month running on barely any hardware and an active Discord server of around 3,000 users.

It's an open source application written almost entirely in TypeScript. You can find the repo here: [github.com/Portaler-Zone/portaler-core](https://github.com/Portaler-Zone/portaler-core)

However, I don't play much of the game anymore. Luckily the application keeps itself updated with map changes automatically.

### Lately

Lately, I've been getting big into Tabletop Role Playing games. I'm not much of a fan of D&D, but love to play a lot of other systems. I run a Living World community called [Agents of Syn](https://agentsofsyn.com), which I'm building some software for. At first glance it might sound edgey, but it's actually kid friendly and the world is based on a [web comic series](https://www.uptofourplayers.com/) that I'm not affiliated with. I definitely think there is a lot more I could do for the TTRPG community if there were 100hrs in a day instead of 24. 

I'm also big into board games and want to do some projects in that space.
