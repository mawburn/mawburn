I have more ideas than time. I am one of the lucky few who's job is also their passion, so I program in my free time a good bit. 

- Enneagram: [Type 3](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-3) — The Achiever
- Myers-Briggs: [ESFP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/esfp-personality) — The Entertainer (Assertive)
  - Fun fact, I was [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) most of my life until I started running Tabletop Roleplaying Games! I did a complete flip!

You can find my main home page at [mawburn.com](https://mawburn.com), though I don't keep up with it like I should. It lists some projects that I do and some other things about me. 

### Side Gig

I run a little 3D Printing and other tabletop crafts shop with my wife:

Technically, it's part of my main job too since I'm [dog fooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) the Shopify platform for a serious business.
