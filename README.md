I have more ideas than time. I am one of the lucky few who's job is also their passion, so I program in my free time a good bit. 

You can find my main home page here, though I don't keep up with it like I should: [mawburn.com](https://mawburn.com)

It lists some projects that I do and some other things about me. 

### Side Gig

I run a little 3D Printing and other tabletop crafts shop with my wife:
