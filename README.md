I have more ideas than time. I am one of the lucky few who's job is also their passion, so I program in my free time a good bit. 

You can find my main home page here, though I don't keep up with it like I should: 

[mawburn.com](https://mawburn.com)

It lists some projects that I do and some other things about me.

I created and run a project called [Portaler](https://portaler.zone). It's a multitenant collaborative mapping application for an MMORPG called Albion Online. As of this writing, I get roughly 21,000 unique vistors a month and with a Discord bot for role-based authentication runing on about 400 servers running on barely any hardware. Also an active [Discord server](https://discord.gg/W2NteY4dDS) of around 3,000 users.

You can find the repo here: [github.com/Portaler-Zone/portaler-core](https://github.com/Portaler-Zone/portaler-core)

I am looking for contributors to maintain and update it.
